## Introduction

In this Challenge I created a Jupyter notebook with 

You can find my analysis, including the answers to the questions from the Challenge instructions in etf_analyzer.ipynb file. For each line of code there is comments, titles for interactive hvplot, necessary professionally styled visualizations are included. 

Voilà library were used to deploy the visualizations to a web application. Here is the video demonstrating deployment of the library via terminal and brief interaction with it on web.


## Why?





## How to install

* Save remote repo from GitHub to your computer (Desktop): in Terninal type:

```
cd desktop

git clone https://github.com/nataliaburrey/SQL_Financial_Application.git
```

now you can find repo on your desktop


* Open a Jupyter Lab: In Terminal type command

```
jupyter lab
```

* In Jupyter Lab access saved repo folder 
* Choose [ etf_analyzer.ipynb ] file to see the analysis report.



## How to use




## Technologies used

### Libraries


We are using Pandas- a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
The following libriries has to be imported:

```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import hvplot.pandas
import sqlalchemy

```

In particular, Pandas offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license.

Following code deploys Voilà library via terminal.

```
voila <relative-path-to-notebook>
```


### Languages 

* Python
* SQL


### Interfaces

* Jupyter Lab
* GitHub



## Helps recruiters

* The project was created in collaboration with Berkeley Fintech Bootcamp team: Allan Hall, Joel Gonzales, Siege.
* Tutor Lavina Tang helped me to polish my code and tought me how to run separate parts of code to see if it works every step.
* AskBCS Learning Assistant channel was used to troubleshoot some of the accuring problems outside of the classroom
